# React-Clicky-Game

This is a memory game created using React. 

The app will render a list of images, each listening for click events. 
THe user's score will be incremented if they click the image for the first time, but if they click the same image more than once, the score will be reset and the game will restart. 

This app is still in process, a static version is rendered and it listens for the first click, however unable to listen to the second.
